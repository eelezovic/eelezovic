## About Me

- ðŸ”­ I am a Software Developer student at Get Coding, where I enrolled in 2022. During my time at Get Coding, I successfully completed my first project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project involved the creation of a personalized agenda with a calendar feature, allowing me to manage appointments and events efficiently. One of the key functionalities of my agenda is the ability to save events to the browser's localStorage, enabling easy access and retrieval at any time. I would greatly appreciate it if you could check out my project at https://eelezovic.github.io/MyAgenda/. In addition, I am currently working on my second project, which involves developing an application to aid in tracking and locating surgical instruments within the Operating Room. The front-end part of this project has been completed, and I am now actively engaged in working on the back-end functionality. Here is the link to my second project; https://github.com/eelezovic/surgitrack

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Instrument Tracking System**

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Node.Js**

- âš¡ Fun fact: **I am a nurse, artist and I love to play Football, aka Soccer :)**
